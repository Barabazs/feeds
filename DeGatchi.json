I had a montiroing system that would provide the inputs and the bytecode generator would chug along and spit out an executable program that I could deploy and call on with a bundle of transactions. In this article I'll share the core of that codebase to get you up to speed! Buckle up, anon. There isn't any other article like this revealing these trade secrets!","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/generating-custom-assembly-smart-contracts","retrieved":1734220800000},{"contents":"So many MEV bots take money from people but why don't people take money from them? I always thought about this when I was in my web3 cybersec assembly arc. I got quite fascinated with reverse engineering them and the contracts they interected with and realised there are some interesting things you can do with the uniswap code, since it has a few assumptions with the tokens you provide to create the pairs. Although not very practical it's definitely an intereting thought experiment that can provoke some further creativity!","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/baiting-mev-bots-univ2-token-trapper","retrieved":1734134400000},{"contents":"After spending years in MEV and web3 infosec DeGatchi explains his reasoning behind switching to malware development. Although seemingly less money and entering an alreaedy mature field, it's clearly the most powerful long term decision to be made -- especially when combining malware development with custom evolutionary AI algorithms.","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/starting-malware-development","retrieved":1733875200000},{"contents":"Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) relies heavily on this very intuitive differentiation-based algorithm called gradient descent. It gets us closer to our desired minima or maxima by starting with a value and adjusting that value based on the change of our gradient. In this article you'll learn to understand what is gradient descent and all the component apart of it. And then explore a few modifications of it from simple to advanced to solidify your understanding!","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/gradient-descent","retrieved":1732406400000},{"contents":"Who dares enter the darkness to find the light?","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/seesaw","retrieved":1728259200000},{"contents":"Can Mathematics convert your religious beliefs?

Instead of being stuck in this limbo, I've made the perfect plan for anyone to chase their dreams.","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/the-perfect-plan","retrieved":1725148800000},{"contents":"It's saddening to see 99% of people lose their spark as they reach adulthood. From curious driven children to mindless robots, oh what a world we live in, or should I say exist in for most. If money wasn't an issue what would you do? If you can't answer this then you have a big problem, anon-kun.","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/dream-a-little","retrieved":1724803200000},{"contents":"When we look at people better than us in a certain something we often don't consider the amount of pain and suffering that person went through to get to that point. A level 3 crook wants to be world-class at something but doesn't go through the torturous regime it takes to get to level 99 and reap the rewards. It's okay, anon-kun.

Whether business or personal branding the concepts apply to both. Branding is the association between entity and things you want to relate to. Whether you're an entrepreneur or a person sitting at your desk at 2 am contemplating 'How do I make content', 'I want to express how I feel', 'I need to share my thoughts with the world in hopes someone, anyone, can find me, relate to me in this desolate sphere we call home' then you're in the right place!","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/build-a-brand","retrieved":1714348800000},{"contents":"Enter the mind of DeGatchi as he moves continents, once again!

I like to think of it as an MMO, where there are different 'classes' or 'roles' that dictate how you play the game, to some degree. However, if you're like me you create multiple characters with different roles because you like to switch things up. You can apply the same concept to web3. Nonetheless, everything interconnects despite specialising in the different fields.","link":"https://degatchi.com/articles/the-areas-of-web3-development","retrieved":1662940800000},{"contents":"So, you've been doing too much PvE and want to get into the on-chain PvP scene. Be wary traveler, this is a lonely environment to be in if you're playing solo. You will spend months building to upkeep your infrastructure to stay competitive in the MEV world on Ethereum, unless you find a very niche strategy.
