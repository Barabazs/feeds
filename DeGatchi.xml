        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) relies heavily on this very intuitive differentiation-based algorithm called gradient descent. It gets us closer to our desired minima or maxima by starting with a value and adjusting that value based on the change of our gradient. In this article you'll learn to understand what is gradient descent and all the component apart of it. And then explore a few modifications of it from simple to advanced to solidify your understanding!]]></content>
